        Pete sis just came back to town and arrived at the street
        race with Dino Brewster who was disliked by Tobe Marshall
        gang. Tobe Marshall won the race and went home victorious.
        It aint't about the ride but the driver said Vin Diesel.
        later Tobe and his gang rebuilt a Ford shelby brought by
        Dino.
        Tobe was able to sell the car at a higer price cos he was
        able to push the car to 328mph, a feat Dino thought was 
        impossibe and strongly discouraged it. Pete laughed him 
        and told him Tobe was a better driver than he was which
        angered him and suggested a compition with three identical
        Agera R  and the winner will take a larger cut from the 
        sold car. during the competition Dino hit the back of Pete 
        car which led to the death of Pete. 
        Dino hid the evidence and Tobe took the fall and went to
        prison. Tobe came out five years letter assembled his 
        team back, borrowed the GT500 to win the De Leon to prove
        his innocence. 
        He wan the race with the Agera R that was used in to
        put Pete six feet deep. after the race he was arrested 
        for ilegal race but spent a short in prison while Dino 
        was put in bars for the murder of Pete
