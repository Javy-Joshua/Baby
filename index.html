        The shelby Ford Mustang seems to be my favourite
        baby, actually its a baby I don't own yet, 
        but I actually love the "bad boy" and the 
        way Tobe Marshall handled it in "Need for Speed"
        was crazy!!. 
        You can't actually watch the movie and not fall
        in love with it. It's basically love at first sight
        just like when Adam saw Eve for the first time and 
        was like damn!!!! this shawtie is more than a 10
        with "ABCD" if you catch my drift.

        While the car in the movie is potrayed to be a 
        shelby Mustang, in truth it was a special one-of- 
        a-kind Ford Mustang GT500  built by Ford and 
        DreamWorks. It came with a custom body as well a
        unique silver paint and Kona blue racing stripes.
        The custom body kit is pretty unique as well with 
        a gaping llower splitter, special air intakes for 
        a more muscled look, and a dual-scoop hood. Bigger
        rocker panel with custom slide scoops, rear diffuser
        as well a a rear spoiler were were futher additions
        to the same. The interiors were also customised to 
        bettter fit the game and the movie llok and create
        futher buzz for the car. you can search for more 
        details at <a href="https//www.hotcars.com" target="_blank">www.hotcars.com</a>. Check out
